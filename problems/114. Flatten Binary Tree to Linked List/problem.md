# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

```text
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

The flattened tree should look like:

```text
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```
